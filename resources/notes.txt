QGIS STEPS:
1. simplify county & fsa shapefiles
2. join canadian & usa vividseats data
3. merge shapefiles
4. join logo url data to merged shapefile
5. run following command in field calulator to create single merged team field
	–  coalesce( "can-final_event" , "us-final_v2_Team")
6. run following command in field calculator to create single merged location field (text 75 characters)
	– coalesce("PRNAME" + ', ' + "CFSAUID", "us-final_v2_county_state", "NAMELSAD" )
7. save merged & joined shapefile to geojson

FURTHER PROCESSING: 
1. import geojson exported from step 7 into mapshaper
2. simplify down to 5-10% & export
3. Find & replace French province names
4. Find & replace NULL locations/teams with empty string ("")
	- this ensures Flourish colours shape as grey (no data), rather than treating NULL as a categorical value


DATA NOTES (from Steven Spiewak @ Vivid)
Here’s first cut at the US data. A few notes:
*This is based on billing zip code.
*This is based on the following seasons: 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019. We could tweak this as well.
*This is regular season only—therefore, it excludes the playoffs (which would skew things).
*This also excludes neutral site games, such as Winter Classic.
*This also excludes parking, “fan fests”, conventions, and other non-games
